Battleship game developed with Test Driven Development (TDD)

Battleship is a classic guessing game worldwide, where two players are each given their own gameboards and ships to place. By guessing coordinates on where to attack, players try to destroy all of their enemies ship in order to win the game. This is personally a game that I grew up with and is one that I have played many times throughout my life. I'll call it Naval Warfareâ„¢ and it will essentially be a ripoff minimalistic battleship game. Enjoy!
